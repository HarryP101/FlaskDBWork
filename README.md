# FlaskDBWork

I have included a setup file which includes all the python packages that are required for this application to run

In order to run it, simply navigate to the source directory where app.py is located and use 'flask run'

This will run the web application for the http api for getting historical data

Running FixerIngester.py will load the data and save it to the database url specified in the file. I ran out of time
